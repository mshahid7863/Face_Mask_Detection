# Problem Statment
With the ongoing global health challenges, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the proper use of face masks in public places has become crucial. Automating the detection of face masks can aid in monitoring and enforcing safety measures, thereby helping to curb the spread of the virus.Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether individuals in images are wearing face masks. The model should classify images into one of two categories: 'mask', 'no mask'
using mask with OpenCV and TensorFlow. Using simple CNN or model provided by TensorFlow as MobileNetV2, VGG16,Resnet50
Developed a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to identify individuals wearing masks and  not wearing masks,  Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow  MobileNetV2, VGG16,Transfer learning and  Keras to train the model on a diverse dataset. Implemented data preprocessing, augmentation, and real-time image processing to enhance model accuracy and performance. Successfully integrated the system into a live video stream for real-time monitoring, achieving a detection accuracy of 95%.
